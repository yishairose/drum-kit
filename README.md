# drum-kit
Drum Kit built with Java Script

The HTML and CSS markup for this JS Drum Kit was created by WesBos, and is provided along with his JavaSript30 course.
I have implemented the JavaScript in this project, by coding alone, and then updating and improving following the video tutorials. 
I have commented the code which I implemented my own way and acheived the same result as the tutorial instructor, and also noted which code is my implementation and which one is the instructors.

Enjoy knocking around on my Drum Kit!
